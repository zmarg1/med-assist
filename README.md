Note: This is a work in progress and does not represent a finished product

Smart medical assistant tool to records, transcribe, and summarize medical appointments. 

Future iterations of the tool will allow users to interact with a chat assistant to answer
questions about past appointments.


## Instructions:

You need to install Whisper (locally) to transcribe audio:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
```

And then you need to install FFmpeg to record and process the audio files:

```
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
